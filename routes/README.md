# Routes

Fresh pages and API endpoints. Each directory or file directly
corresponds to a route on the site. Files beginning with an underscore
such as `_app.tsx` or `_middleware.ts` provide global behavior.

Route modules export a `handler` for API requests or a page component for
server-side rendering.
