# Playwright Nightly Pipeline Setup Summary

This document summarizes the GitHub Actions setup for running Playwright tests nightly and displaying results in GitHub.

## What Was Created

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### ðŸŒ™ Nightly Playwright Tests (`/.github/workflows/nightly-tests.yml`)

- **Schedule**: Runs at 2 AM UTC daily
- **Purpose**: Daily health check of the application
- **Features**:
  - Runs all Playwright tests across multiple browsers
  - Uploads test results and screenshots as artifacts
  - Generates test summaries in GitHub
  - Creates test status badges
  - Can be manually triggered

#### ðŸ§ª Playwright Tests (`/.github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml`)

- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs to main/develop
- **Purpose**: Validate changes before merging
- **Features**:
  - Runs tests on every PR and push
  - Comments on pull requests with test results
  - Parses and displays detailed test statistics
  - Uploads artifacts for review
  - Removes duplicate comments on PRs

### 2. Documentation

#### `GITHUB_ACTIONS.md`

- Comprehensive guide to the GitHub Actions workflows
- Explains how to use and customize the workflows
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices

#### `BADGES.md`

- Instructions for adding test status badges to README
- Example badge URLs
- Badge color explanations

#### `SETUP_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

- Overview of what was created
- Quick start guide

### 3. Testing Tools

#### `test-workflow.sh`

- Script to test the workflow setup locally
- Validates Node.js, Deno, and Playwright installation
- Tests development server startup
- Verifies Playwright configuration

## How It Works

### Environment Setup

1. **Node.js 20** - For Playwright and npm dependencies
2. **Deno v2.x** - For the application server
3. **Playwright browsers** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile browsers
4. **Dependency caching** - For faster builds

### Test Execution

1. Install dependencies and browsers
2. Start the development server (`deno task start`)
3. Run Playwright tests across all configured browsers
4. Upload test results and screenshots as artifacts
5. Generate summaries and comments

### GitHub Integration

1. **Pull Request Comments** - Automatic test result comments
2. **Step Summaries** - Detailed test statistics in workflow runs
3. **Artifacts** - Downloadable test results and screenshots
4. **Badges** - Visual status indicators

## Quick Start

### 1. Test Locally

```bash
cd playwright
./test-workflow.sh
```

### 2. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Playwright nightly pipeline"
git push
```

### 3. Monitor Results

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Check workflow runs
3. Download artifacts if needed
4. Review test summaries

### 4. Add Badges to README

Add these to your main README.md:

```markdown
![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/workflows/ðŸ§ª%20Playwright%20Tests/badge.svg)
![Nightly Tests](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/workflows/ðŸŒ™%20Nightly%20Playwright%20Tests/badge.svg)
```

## Configuration

### Test Browsers

The workflows test against:

- Chrome (Desktop)
- Firefox (Desktop)
- Safari (Desktop)
- Chrome (Mobile)
- Safari (Mobile)

### Timeouts

- **Job timeout**: 30 minutes
- **Test timeout**: 5 minutes per test
- **Navigation timeout**: 5 minutes
- **Action timeout**: 5 minutes

### Retries

- **CI retries**: 2 retries for failed tests
- **Parallel execution**: Disabled on CI for stability

## Artifacts

### Test Results

- **JSON files**: Detailed test results
- **HTML reports**: Interactive test reports
- **Trace files**: For debugging failed tests

### Screenshots

- **Test screenshots**: Visual test results
- **Error screenshots**: Screenshots on test failures
- **Debug screenshots**: Manual screenshots for debugging

## Monitoring

### Daily Health Check

The nightly workflow provides:

- Daily application health status
- Regression detection
- Performance monitoring
- Visual regression testing

### Pull Request Validation

The PR workflow provides:

- Immediate feedback on changes
- Quality gate for merging
- Detailed test statistics
- Visual verification of changes

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor the first runs** - Check that everything works correctly
2. **Add more tests** - Expand test coverage as needed
3. **Customize workflows** - Adjust timeouts, browsers, or triggers
4. **Set up alerts** - Configure notifications for test failures
5. **Optimize performance** - Tune test execution for faster feedback

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Review the troubleshooting section in `GITHUB_ACTIONS.md`
3. Test locally using `test-workflow.sh`
4. Check the HTML reports in the artifacts

The setup is designed to be robust and provide comprehensive feedback for maintaining application quality.
